# card-sorting-application
The Card Sorting Application allows for the sorting of a deck of cards based on specific rules, including special cards. The API provides endpoints to submit a list of cards and receive a sorted list in return. The React-based UI component consumes this API and offers an intuitive interface to input their cards and view the sorted results.
